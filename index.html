<h2>What are my future goals at SEAL?</h2>

<p>At SEALS, <strong>my goal is to improve my skill in coding and leadership skills.</strong> From these skills, I would use them for engineering. Coding is very critical in Engineering because many airplanes, cars, and many things we build are made out of a coding platform. For example, I learned that self-driving cars run on according to the platform. Technology is used everywhere, and it is necessary to understand this concept. 

    I love aeronautical engineering, which is designing and engineering airplanes. For instance, I learned that designing airplanes is done by a platform called AutoCAD, where you create a layout of an aircraft design and test its efficiency. 
    
    Sometimes, Aeronautical engineering does not involve every coding platform, but it is good to learn new things so you can apply them to your career. So I consider choosing SEALS as a goal to help me add the skill of coding to my career.

            <h1>Experience</h1>
            <p>My experience at SCLA was amazing!. I enjoyed doing mental activities on the camp field trip. Speaking up was an amazing experience for me. I enjoyed playing mental games that involved strategies and how to improve better. In addition, I learned how to manage my team and my responsibilities. There was a story that I want to share that is related to team responsibility. One time, I and my team weren’t in perfect shape. There was less communication in the group and sometimes ideas were disliked, and no solution came out. We always argue which makes it difficult for a team to make themselves better.

                So I asked for help from my coach of the team about how to solve arguments and communication problems? He told me that it was my job as a project manager of the team to look after what each team member is doing, and ask him questions or notify him about an idea. He also told me to accept the idea of my team member instead of arguing. This is true in some cases because I could think I am right, but I am actually wrong. If I don’t like an idea, I can make the idea better by asking questions, add to the idea, or bring a new idea. I can also challenge the idea, but not in a harsh way that I dislike it.

            <h1>Skills</h1>
            <p>Some skills I have are understanding physics and aerodynamics. Since I was 13 years old, I had been interested in STEM for so long. I developed this skill when I did science fair projects at my middle school. It first started when I did a science project on car efficiency. I became very interested in this subject as I dug through my research. Then I did another project almost related to the first one. It was about burning fossil fuels vs biofuels. I did another project about aircraft winglet efficiency, which was about what wing design reduces turbulency on an aircraft. I started to realize the connection I had with these projects when I found out they all belong to the same theme of efficiency and saving the environment. From this connection, I found my passion for engineering. This passion became a skill because I was very good at understanding these concepts.</p>
